For this project I needed to take a file containing college courses and their information and load them into a data structure of my choosing. Once they are loaded into the application the user should be able to choose whether they want to list all courses in alphanumeric order or find a specific course. To start this project, I created pseudocode for three different types of data structures, vector, hash table, and binary tree, and then decided which one would work best for me in this situation. I chose binary tree as I thought it made more sense to have an ordered data structure to make it easier to print the list in alphanumeric order. I think the biggest roadblock I had to overcome was parsing the input file to put it into the data structure. To overcome this roadblock, I researched different ways to parse files and then picked and chose which I thought would work best in my situation and it ended up working out great. 
This project opened my eyes to how important it is to pick a good data structure for a specific situation. If I had gone with something else, I would have had much worse runtime or would have had to type many more lines of code to achieve the same result. I also think algorithms in general have opened my eyes to how important it is to make code that is reusable. The code that I created could be used for many different situations with minor changes and that can save so much time in development.
